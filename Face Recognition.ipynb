    "# <u>Face Recognition System\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays there are many ways of authenticating yourself, like using password, retina scan, fingerprint etc. Face can also be used for this purpose. In this notebook we will make a face recognition system using Siamese network.\n",
    "This is different from face verification where the task is to know whether given two input images are same or not.\n",
    "Here the task is see whether the given input image is of any person who is registered with the system or not. There can be multiple users registered with the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of **Siamese Network** is that it allows a way to do this sort of verification task with very little user data, as it is quite unreasonable to train using thousands of images for each user. Here we will be using **FaceNet Model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. So by comparing two such vectors, we can then determine if two pictures are of the same person."
